# Diego's dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles. To learn more about dotfiles see the
[awesome dotfiles list](https://github.com/webpro/awesome-dotfiles).

**⚠️ Before using this project:**

- Use and remix at your own risk.
- Check the script sources, understand what they do, and see if it applies to
  your system and tastes.
- These scripts are intended for **macOS**.

## Installation

1. You'll need to have `git` and the Xcode Command Line Tools installed (macOS
   will prompt to install the tools the first time you use `git`)
2. Clone this repo
3. Run `./install-tools.sh` to install Homebrew and other tools
4. Run `./install-config.sh` to write the configuration in your home (the old
   files are stored in `./backup` using git, so you can rollback to previous
   versions)
